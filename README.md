# WEEK 1 TOY PROBLEMS

# Introduction
This is a project which solves three toy problems with JavaScript. Each problem is unique and requires a different solution to produce the desired output. Each problem is indicated at the top of each .js file as a comment.

# Getting started
The project files are speed-detector.js, net-salary-calculator.js and student-grade-generator.js. To access them, follow the installation instructions below.

# Installation
- Fork and clone this repository into your local environment.
- Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run code . to open the files in Visual Studio Code.
- At the bottom of each solution, there is a console.log function with an argument in it. Change the value of the argument as desired to ascertain that the code is running smoothly.

# Known Bugs
The net-salary-calculator problem is yet to be solved conclusively. I ran into bugs while trying to create iterations to go through the payeBrackets and nhifRates objects to find the appropriate values to return.
